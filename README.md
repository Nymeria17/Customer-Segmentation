# Customer Segmentation Chatbot - README

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Customer-segmentation.ipynb`) that demonstrates a customer segmentation analysis using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data visualization and clustering algorithms to group customers based on their characteristics.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Visualization of customer data distributions
- Implementation of clustering algorithms (likely K-Means based on the notebook content)
- Interactive visualizations of customer segments
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you'll need:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation-chatbot
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `Customer-segmentation.ipynb`
3. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis

## Notebook Structure
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Clustering)
5. Visualization of Segments
6. Interpretation of Results

## Results
The notebook produces visualizations that show:
- Customer data distributions
- Cluster visualizations (likely using PCA for dimensionality reduction)
- Characteristics of each customer segment
